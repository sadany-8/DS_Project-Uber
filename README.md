## 🚖 Uber Data Science Project
## 📌 Project Description

This project analyzes Uber trip data to uncover business insights, customer behavior patterns, and operational challenges. By applying data science and machine learning techniques, we aim to improve decision-making for pricing, driver allocation, customer satisfaction, and fraud detection.

The dataset covers the year 2024, including trips, payments, cancellations, ratings, and geographic details.

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Ride-hailing platforms like Uber generate vast amounts of data daily. However, without proper analysis, valuable insights remain hidden.

Key challenges include:

Understanding revenue drivers across different payment methods.

Identifying cancellation patterns from both customers and drivers.

Measuring service quality through ratings.

Ensuring data consistency, completeness, and reliability.

Building predictive models to optimize operations.

## ❓ Key Questions Explored

Which payment method contributes most to Uber’s revenue?

What are the main reasons for cancellations, from both customers and drivers?

How do customer and driver ratings vary across vehicle types?

How reliable is the dataset in terms of quality and coverage?

Which machine learning model can best predict customer cancellations and driver acceptance?

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

We experiment with different ML approaches to address business problems:

Classification Models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)

Predicting whether a ride will be canceled (customer/driver).

Regression Models (Linear Regression, Gradient Boosting)

Estimating trip fare based on distance, time, and demand.

Clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN)

Grouping customers by ride frequency, payment preference, and location.

Recommendation Models

Suggesting optimal vehicle types for customers based on past rides and ratings.
